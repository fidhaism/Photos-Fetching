This code consists of two main parts: an HTML file (index.html) and a JavaScript file (main.js).

HTML (index.html): This file sets up the structure of the webpage. It includes the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries for styling and functionality. It also includes a <div> with the id result, where the fetched data will be displayed.

JavaScript (main.js): This file contains the logic to fetch and display data from an API. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
It starts by declaring an empty string htmlData.

It then makes a fetch request to the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos API.
The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. This is logged to the console.

The then method is used to extract the JSON body content from the response using res.json().
Another then method is used to handle the data returned from the previous then. It slices the first 50 items from the data and logs them to the console.

It then loops over each item in the data array, and for each item, it creates a Bootstrap card with the item’s image and title. This HTML string is added to htmlData.

Finally, it sets the innerHTML of the result div to htmlData, effectively displaying the cards on the webpage.

If there’s an error at any point in this process, it’s caught and logged to the console with catch.
This code essentially fetches data from an API and displays it on a webpage in the form of Bootstrap cards. Each card shows an image and a title from the fetched data. The user can modify this code to fetch different data or change how the data is displayed.
